# Unscented Kalman Filter Project

In this project utilize an **Unscented Kalman Filter** to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

The **CTRV** (Constant Turn Rate and Velocity magnitude) model was used.

This project involves the Term 2 **Simulator** which can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. 
For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. 

Once the install for **uWebSocketIO** is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

Here is the main protcol that **main.cpp** uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.

INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

* ["sensor_measurement"] => the measurment that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)

OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

* ["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
* ["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
* ["rmse_x"]
* ["rmse_y"]
* ["rmse_vx"]
* ["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies

* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt`. You can find
   some sample inputs in 'data/'.
    - eg. `./UnscentedKF ../data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt`

## Generating Additional Data

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
